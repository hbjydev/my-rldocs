# Rocky Linux 8 Documentation

Rocky Linux documentation describes how to install and administer the Rocky
Linux operating system, as well as the software packaged by its maintainer, the
Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation (RESF). It covers the following 3 topics:

- [Release Notes](./release-notes)
- [Installation](./installation)
- [Administration](./administration)

This project is run specifically by community member & team lead @hbjy, who is
not maintaining this officially under the Rocky Linux project or the RESF.
